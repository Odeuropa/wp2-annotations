# Annotation Guidelines

## Basics
- We use [CVAT](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/cvat) as image annotation tool. An instance is accessible via http://lme187.cs.fau.de:12444. 
- In order to create annotations, you need to be registered as a user. You can create one yourself or notify us, so we do it for you (preferred). 

### Task Overview
- Once logged in, you will be taken to the task overview. The artworks are ordered thematically, depending on the query keywords that was used in image retrieval.
- Select one of the tasks according to your interest and the project need, our current annotation focus is `still-lifes-color`.
